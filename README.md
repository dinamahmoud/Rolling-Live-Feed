##	Rolling Live Feed

Sensors detect occupied workstations and project their desktops onto a large screen in the office, switching screens every 15 minutes.

## Scenario
To promote productivity and collaboration, the desktop of each person working at the office will be projected in the space for 15 minutes at intervals depending on the occupancy of the office.
This can be done locally within a single office, or across multiple international workspaces.


### Sub-Section

Motion sensors will detect which workstations are occupied, and will activate that station to be put in the projector queue.
Every 15 minutes, the display will shift to the next workstation in the queue, projecting a live feed of their desktop.
